15 minute recorded vote now underway, general debate to follow. #hcr

rep. jan schakowsy from my neighbor state across the river is seriously fired up in favor of #hcr right now on cspan.

1 vote down, 2 to go before the house finishes its job on #hcr. 224 yes on rule makes me predict 219 to 222 votes for final passage-needs216

cbs colleague @jacksonjk reports latest guidance that house vote on #hcr may not happen till after 10p/et & reconciliation after 11p.

#hcr debate makes it clear dems & reps aren't simply on opposite sides of an aisle. they apparently live on different planets.

democrat dem. obey balks - such a request must be cleared. #hcr

the passage of this #hcr takeover lays in the hands of just a few dems, we are keeping the heat on them and you should too. speak up!

whoopi goldberg said it best when speaking about #hcr.  directed to members of the house and senate ''gimme what you got''.

also, i <3 rep. louise slaughter (d-ny). #p2 #hcr

i can't see why #hcr would not be passed! what's the alternative?!? the status quo with morbidity

norm ornstein: ''if tom daschle had been confirmed before tim geithner, you would have seen a #hcr signing ceremony 4 months ago.'' i agree.

for every minute the house continues to argue about #hcr... two more people die of heart attacks.

according to my pal tim noah, who's been covering #hcr for slate, passage of the bill is all but a done deal as of now.please be right, tim.

i wonder how many of those #hcr protestors took the government run public transportation to get to their anti govt rally?

seriously, republicans shouldn't be so dismayed. after all we're talking about helping more americans get health coverage #hcr

another reason to pass #hcr: if obama can pull this off, he can start acting like he actually has a mandate

there is hope for america #hcr #herman

i can't imagine the pressure of living without healthcare, especially for people with children. who in their right mind would oppose #hcr?
